Random Code (or whatever you want to call this)
==========

Just random code I wrote or found around...

or both things (based on some implementation of something somewhere, changed some of its code, or maybe reworked some small things, based on some weird ideas I saw somewhere, who knows)


## Random things (in C)

* ltun/*   based on libdnet (dumbnet on debian) (for fixing a bug I felt in IPoIRC)
* base64/* code ("heavily") based on http://doctrina.org/Base64-With-OpenSSL-C-API.html
* thread/* idea came out of jthread, saw it could be nice when handling lots of threads (or somewhere, I guess), and well, I just implemented a very cheap version (there is probably a better library for this around
* regex/*  based on the pcredemo example (a bit modified though, for using a nicer interface)

## Random things (in Racket)

* interpolar.rkt - some fancy implementation of newton's divided differences, hacked it until I understood (somewhat) them

## Random things (in Haskell)

* play.repl.hs - small REPL interface for pico2wave
