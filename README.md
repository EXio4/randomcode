Random Code (or whatever you want to call this)
==========

## Random things (C/)

* ltun/*   based on libdnet (dumbnet on debian) (for fixing a bug I had with IPoIRC)
* base64/* code ("heavily") based on http://doctrina.org/Base64-With-OpenSSL-C-API.html
* thread/* idea came out of jthread, saw it could be nice when handling lots of threads (or somewhere, I guess), and well, I just implemented a very cheap version (there is probably a better library for this around
* regex/*  based on the pcredemo example (a bit modified though, for using a nicer interface)

## Random things (Racket/)

* interpolar.rkt - some fancy implementation of newton's divided differences, hacked it until I understood (somewhat) them
* draw-exio4.rkt - just playing with racket's pict library, drawing my nick and name with it

## Random things (Haskell/)

* play.repl.hs - small REPL interface for pico2wave
* tags - naive good-enough (for not a lot of data) tag manager
* lazy-machines - proof-of-concept algorithm of a partially lazy evaluated graph for a game
* gen-map - png->minetest schematic converter (rough, it works and everything, but still not finished)
* vfs - just a demo-ish vfs because I wanted to play with data families and things
* markov - just playing around with a markov chains
* daily/ - solutions to random problems in /r/dailyprogrammer
* useless_flatten.hs - flatten over.. arbitrarily nested data structures (using monad because I needed something polymorphic) 

## Advent of code (advent/)

* solutions to http://adventofcode.com/
